# For use Git anf GitHub:
Hereinafeter the best practice is working basing on this repo.
* For clone the repo:
~~~
git clone -b 'branch-to-use' https://github.com/QC-APP-UN/Quant.git
~~~
Working in develop branch could be dangerous, please create a new branch: For crate a new branch, GitHub offers a easy way, first type the name of the new branch in the search bar for branchs, a create option will appear.

Once you have cloned the branch you can begin to work.

* For add changes:

~~~
git add *
~~~

use in the root directory of the repo, for add all the changes.

* For commits:
~~~
git commit -m 'brief message to describe the commit'
~~~
* For push:
with this you can upload the changes to the GitHub, be carefull.
~~~
git push origin 'branch-to-use'
~~~

if you donÂ´t use `origin 'branch-to-use'` there exists the posibility of upload in develop branch, use `git branch` for see the branch that you are using. 
For a Pull Request a good tutorial is: https://blog.desdelinux.net/tutorial-simple-primer-pr-pull-request/ But I can do it if you have a problem. In the tutorial there is a more general explanation of what is explained here. 

You can use the GUI for Version Control in Netbeans, but I recommend the use via console. For windows you can use the git console.
